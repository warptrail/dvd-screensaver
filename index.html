<h2>Ethereal Loops</h2>
<p style="background-color:burlywood">This is a piece of code based off a simple brick game tutorial from Mozilla. I was attempting to get the ball to change colors for each square it passes through. However it only does so for one of the squares and I do not know why. It is something I hope to figure out someday.</p>
